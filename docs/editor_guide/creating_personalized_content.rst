Creating personalized content
=============================

Once you've created a segment you can start serving these visitors with
personalised content. To do this, you can go one of three directions.

1. Create a copy of a page for your segment.

2. Create StreamField blocks only visible to your segment.

3. Create a template block only visible to your segment.


Method 1: Create a copy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create a copy from a page for a specific Segment (which you can change to
your liking after copying it) simply go to the Explorer section and find the
page you'd wish to personalize.

You'll notice a new "Variants" dropdown button has appeared. Click the button
and select the segment you'd like to create personalized content for.

Once you've selected the segment, a copy of the page will be created with a
title that includes the segment. Don't worry, your visitors won't be able to
see this title.

You can change everything on this page you'd like. Visitors that are included in
your segment, will automatically see the new page you've created for them.


Method 2: Use a StreamField block
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This method requires implementation in your back-end. Take a look at
:doc:`../usage_guide/implementation` for more information.


Method 3: Use a template block
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This method requires implementation in your back-end. Take a look at
:doc:`../usage_guide/implementation` for more information.
