The segments dashboard
======================

Wagxperience comes with two different views for it's segment dashboard. A "list
view" and a "dashboard view". Where the dashboard view attempts to show all
relevant information and statistics in a visually pleasing manner, the list view
is more fitted for sites using large amounts of segments, as it may be
considered more clear in these cases.
