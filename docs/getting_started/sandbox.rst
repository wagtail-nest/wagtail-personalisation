Using the sandbox
=================

To experiment with the package you can use the sandbox provided in
the repository_. It includes a couple of segments with rules, a personalisable
page with a variant and a personalisable StreamField block.

To install this you will need to create and activate a
virtualenv and then run ``make sandbox``. This will start a fresh Wagtail
install, with the personalisation module enabled, on http://localhost:8000
and http://localhost:8000/cms/. The superuser credentials are
``superuser@example.com`` with the password ``testing``.
